Got it, Nate Dawg! I'll find high-performance JavaScript or React libraries that can apply CRT-style visual effects (scanlines, chromatic aberration, phosphor glow, screen warp, blur) to an entire web app. Priority is given to WebGL-based solutions for wider support, with possible WebGPU options. I'll also look into ways to ensure the cursor effect is included. 

I'll get back to you with the best options soon!

# Applying CRT-Style Effects to a Whole Web App

**Overview:** Achieving a retro CRT look (warp, blur, scanlines, chromatic aberration, glow) for an entire web app is best done with GPU-accelerated post-processing. The general approach is to render the page into a texture and apply a fragment shader across the whole viewport ([javascript - Old school tv edge-warping effect? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46857876/old-school-tv-edge-warping-effect#:~:text=28)). WebGL-based solutions are currently the most practical (for Safari compatibility and wide support), though WebGPU can be considered for future-proofing. Below we discuss libraries and techniques to implement these effects globally, plus how to include the cursor in the effect.

## WebGL-Based Libraries for CRT Effects

- **VFX-JS / React-VFX:** A library that makes it easy to apply WebGL fragment shaders to DOM content. It provides React components (or direct JS API via VFX-JS) for images, videos, and even text. You can wrap your entire app (or a container) in a shader effect by rendering it to an offscreen element. For example, React-VFX provides a `<VFXSpan>` or similar wrapper that renders its children into a WebGL texture and applies a shader ([VFX-JS: WebGL Effects Made Easy | Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2025/01/20/vfx-js-webgl-effects-made-easy/#:~:text=import%20,js%2Fcore)). This could be used to wrap a top-level App component and apply a custom CRT shader. VFX-JS (the underlying core) allows attaching a shader to an element by ID or reference ([VFX-JS: WebGL Effects Made Easy | Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2025/01/20/vfx-js-webgl-effects-made-easy/#:~:text=import%20,js%2Fcore)). *Usage example:* 

  ```jsx
  import { VFX, VFXSpan } from 'react-vfx';
  const AppWithCRT = () => (
    <VFX.VFXProvider>
      <VFX.VFXSpan shader="rgbShift"> 
        <App/> {/* Your entire app's JSX */}
      </VFX.VFXSpan>
    </VFX.VFXProvider>
  );
  ```
  In plain JS, you could similarly do: 
  ```js
  const vfx = new VFX();
  vfx.add(document.body, { shader: 'rgbShift' });
  ``` 
  (Here `'rgbShift'` or `'glitch'` are example built-in shaders ([VFX-JS: WebGL Effects Made Easy | Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2025/01/20/vfx-js-webgl-effects-made-easy/#:~:text=import%20,js%2Fcore)); you can also provide a custom fragment shader string). This approach uses WebGL under the hood to apply effects like RGB shift, scanline, etc., to the content. **Performance:** VFX-JS uses WebGL and keeps the element’s texture on the GPU, so it’s fairly efficient. However, wrapping an entire app might require rendering the DOM to a canvas/texture first – ensure you only update the texture on changes to avoid unnecessary re-renders. Safari is supported (WebGL1/2); just avoid effects that rely on WebGL2 if Safari’s WebGL2 support is not available (React-VFX’s core will fallback to WebGL1 features).

- **Curtains.js:** Curtains is a WebGL library that can **convert HTML elements into WebGL textures** (called “planes”) and apply shaders to them ([curtains.js | Home](https://www.curtainsjs.com/#:~:text=curtains,to%20animate%20them%20via%20shaders)). It’s commonly used for animating images/videos with shaders, but it can handle canvases and even text (by drawing text to a canvas) ([curtains.js | Home](https://www.curtainsjs.com/#:~:text=curtains,to%20animate%20them%20via%20shaders)) ([curtains.js | Home](https://www.curtainsjs.com/#:~:text=Canvas)). You could use Curtains.js to treat your entire application as one canvas texture: for instance, render your app’s output to a `<canvas>` (possibly via an offscreen canvas or using a library like html2canvas for static captures), then create a Curtains.js Plane with that canvas. From there, you can write a fragment shader that implements CRT effects (barrel distortion for screen warp, color offsets for chromatic aberration, scanline darkening, glow, etc.). Curtains also supports **post-processing passes on the whole scene** ([curtains.js | Home](https://www.curtainsjs.com/#:~:text=to%20add%20WebGL%20responsive%20planes,all%20over%20your%20pages)), meaning you could add a global shader effect without individually wrapping every element. *Usage outline:* initialize a `Curtains` instance, create a Plane for the target element or canvas, and supply vertex/fragment shader code for the CRT effect. Curtains will handle syncing the plane’s size/position with the DOM and drawing the shader each frame. **Performance:** Curtains is optimized for high-performance animation and can leverage WebGL efficiently. It uses requestAnimationFrame and keeps everything on the GPU. Make sure to only redraw as needed (Curtains can update on each frame or on demand). Safari’s WebGL should handle Curtains fine (it uses WebGL1 by default with extensions). Ensure any WebGL2 features in your shader have fallbacks if targeting Safari.

- **Three.js + Postprocessing:** If you’re open to using Three.js, you can render your entire UI onto a texture and then use Three’s post-processing stack to apply CRT effects. One approach is to place your page inside an `<iframe>` or offscreen canvas, use `html2canvas` to get an image of it, or if your app already uses Canvas (e.g. a game), use that canvas directly. Then create a Three.js scene with a single large plane that has this texture. You can then apply shader passes:
  - **Barrel Distortion (Warp):** A custom shader or use a lens distortion shader to curve the edges ([javascript - Old school tv edge-warping effect? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46857876/old-school-tv-edge-warping-effect#:~:text=28)).
  - **Blur:** For a fullscreen blur, use a **Gaussian blur pass** or Two-Pass Blur (horizontal & vertical) for efficiency. Three.js’ `UnrealBloomPass` can also add glow/blur to bright areas (simulating phosphor bloom).
  - **Scanlines:** You can overlay scanlines by modulating the brightness every few pixels in the fragment shader (e.g. a sine wave based on Y coordinate) or by overlaying a semi-transparent striped texture. Three.js’s built-in **FilmPass** simulates scanlines and noise (originally for old TV/film effects).
  - **Chromatic Aberration:** Use an RGB shift effect – offset the red, green, blue channels slightly from each other. The **postprocessing** npm library (by vanruesc) has a `ChromaticAberrationEffect` you can plug into an EffectComposer, or you can write a shader that samples the texture at slightly offset UVs for each color channel ([cool-retro-hyper - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cool-retro-hyper#:~:text=pixelization%3A%20false%2C%20rgbSplit%3A%200,08)).
  - **Phosphor Glow:** Apply a bloom/glow filter – Three.js has `UnrealBloomPass`, or in the postprocessing library you have `BloomEffect`. This will cause bright areas (white UI elements, etc.) to bleed light, mimicking CRT phosphor glow ([cool-retro-hyper - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cool-retro-hyper#:~:text=coolRetroHyper%3A%20,75)).
  
  *Usage example:* Use an EffectComposer with multiple passes – e.g., `composer.addPass(new RenderPass(scene, camera))`, then add a custom `ShaderPass` for barrel distortion + scanlines, an `EffectPass` for chromatic aberration, and a `BloomEffect` for glow. The **cool-retro-hyper** project (a Hyper terminal plugin) demonstrated a similar pipeline using Three.js + postprocessing: it combined bloom, curvature, RGB split, noise, flicker, etc., to mimic *cool-retro-term*’s CRT look ([cool-retro-hyper - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cool-retro-hyper#:~:text=coolRetroHyper%3A%20,2)) ([cool-retro-hyper - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cool-retro-hyper#:~:text=pixelization%3A%20false%2C%20rgbSplit%3A%200,08)). Those parameters show how multiple effects are tuned together (e.g. `screenCurvature`, `noise`, `glowingLine` intensity, `flickering`, and an `rgbSplit` amount for color separation) ([cool-retro-hyper - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cool-retro-hyper#:~:text=coolRetroHyper%3A%20,75)) ([cool-retro-hyper - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cool-retro-hyper#:~:text=pixelization%3A%20false%2C%20rgbSplit%3A%200,08)). You can achieve these with Three.js shaders/passes. **Performance:** Three.js with an EffectComposer is quite performant if your GPU can handle fullscreen shader passes at 60fps. Use as few passes as possible by combining effects into one shader where you can (e.g., one fragment shader could do warp + scanline + color shift in one pass). Also consider rendering the effect at a slightly lower resolution and upscaling, if performance is tight, since full HD fullscreen effects can be heavy. Safari supports Three.js well under WebGL1; if using WebGL2 features or postprocessing, test on Safari – you may need to enable HalfFloat textures for bloom or ensure extensions like OES_texture_float are enabled for older Safari.

- **glfx.js (Evan Wallace’s glfx):** An older but handy library for image-based WebGL effects. It treats an input image or canvas and applies shader effects like **bulge/pinch (for screen warp)**, **vignette**, **brightness/contrast**, etc. Zachstronaut’s blog demonstrates using glfx.js to create a fake CRT for a canvas game – he drew scanlines and then used glfx’s *bulgePinch* and *vignette* filters ([WebGL Fake CRT Effect for HTML5 Games - zachstronaut](https://www.zachstronaut.com/posts/2012/08/17/webgl-fake-crt-html5.html#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Apply%20WebGL%20magic%20glcanvas,floor%281000%20%2F%2040%29%29%3B)). With glfx, you could capture your page as an `<canvas>` (using `document.querySelector('body').toDataURL()` via a library or an HTML snapshot) and then apply `.bulgePinch`, `.tiltShift` (for blur), and custom shader if needed for chromatic aberration. However, glfx.js isn’t as flexible as writing your own shader – it has a fixed set of filters. It may not have chromatic aberration out-of-the-box, so you’d likely need to extend it. **Performance:** glfx is WebGL accelerated and was designed for real-time use on images, so it’s decently fast. The example ran at ~40 FPS with a moderate resolution on Chrome ([WebGL Fake CRT Effect for HTML5 Games - zachstronaut](https://www.zachstronaut.com/posts/2012/08/17/webgl-fake-crt-html5.html#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Apply%20WebGL%20magic%20glcanvas,floor%281000%20%2F%2040%29%29%3B)), but Safari (circa 2012) struggled ([WebGL Fake CRT Effect for HTML5 Games - zachstronaut](https://www.zachstronaut.com/posts/2012/08/17/webgl-fake-crt-html5.html#:~:text=I%20created%20a%20realtime%20fake,that%20it%20wouldn%27t%20make%20players)). Modern Safari should handle it, but since glfx is old, test for any WebGL quirks. If you only need a mild warp + scanline and can pre-render some static parts, glfx could be the simplest drop-in.

- **CRT Shader Libraries:** There are also specialized CRT shader implementations:
  - **@4bitlabs/crt-lite:** a tiny WebGL2-based library specifically for CRT effects on an ImageData ([@4bitlabs/crt-lite - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@4bitlabs/crt-lite#:~:text=A%20tiny%2C%20simple%20CRT,ImageData)) ([@4bitlabs/crt-lite - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@4bitlabs/crt-lite#:~:text=Setting%20Type%20Description%20,line%20simulation)). You provide an ImageData (e.g., from a canvas of your app) and it renders a curved, scanned image on a WebGL canvas. It has options for curvature (`Fx, Fy`), blur (`hBlur`), **grain/noise**, vignette, and toggles for **scanlines** ([@4bitlabs/crt-lite - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@4bitlabs/crt-lite#:~:text=Setting%20Type%20Description%20,line%20simulation)) ([@4bitlabs/crt-lite - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@4bitlabs/crt-lite#:~:text=const%20crtOptions%3A%20CrtUpdateOptions%20%3D%20,0%2C%20scanLines%3A%20true%2C)). For example, you can set `Fx/Fy` for screen warp and `scanLines: true` ([@4bitlabs/crt-lite - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@4bitlabs/crt-lite#:~:text=const%20,canvasEl)). However, you’d need to continuously capture your app into an ImageData to use this, which can be expensive. It might be useful if your app can render itself to a `<canvas>` directly (e.g., a game loop or using Canvas API for UI).
  - **PixiJS CRT Filter:** If your app is canvas-based and you use PixiJS, there’s a [CRTFilter](https://github.com/pixijs/filters/tree/main/filters/crt) in pixi-filters. It can add curvature, line noise, and RGB split to a Pixi stage with one line. This is more for canvas/webGL games, but worth noting if applicable (Safari would support it via WebGL).

**Note:** If you cannot easily capture the whole DOM to a canvas in real-time (because html2canvas is too slow for continuous use), consider using **CSS** as a simpler fallback. Pure CSS can’t do complex warping, but you can approximate the look:
  - Add an SVG filter or CSS `filter` to slightly bulge the corners (limited support).
  - Use a semi-transparent PNG or CSS gradient overlay for scanlines (e.g., a repeating linear-gradient with dark lines every few pixels).
  - Use `filter: blur(px)` for a subtle blur, and maybe `filter: drop-shadow()` or duplicating layers for glow.
  - Use multiple layers with slight `filter: hue-rotate()` or separate colored shadows to fake chromatic aberration.  
  This won’t be as authentic, but as one Reddit discussion noted, you can get “pretty close” with clever CSS blend modes and filters with far less effort ([Is it possible to effect the entirety of a website with a shader? : r/web_design](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/1fmlkjq/is_it_possible_to_effect_the_entirety_of_a/#:~:text=Or%20dont%20do%20any%20of,of%20examples%20of%20CRT%20effects)). The trade-off is you won’t have true curved distortion.

## WebGPU Considerations

WebGPU is the next-gen graphics API that can run even more complex shaders and compute, but it’s still *bleeding edge*. As of early 2025, Safari’s WebGPU support is **experimental** (behind flags or Technology Preview). For wider audience reach, you’d still rely on WebGL for now. If you want to future-proof or experiment with WebGPU:
- Frameworks like **Babylon.js** can automatically use WebGPU if available (they’ve worked on transparent WebGL/WebGPU support ([Transparently supporting both WebGL and WebGPU in Babylon.js](https://babylonjs.medium.com/transparently-supporting-both-webgl-and-webgpu-in-babylon-js-8379272a4306#:~:text=Transparently%20supporting%20both%20WebGL%20and,GLSL%20for%20WebGPU%27s%20shader%20language))). Babylon has a post-process system where you could plug in a CRT shader, and it will run on WebGPU when possible ([Transparently supporting both WebGL and WebGPU in Babylon.js](https://babylonjs.medium.com/transparently-supporting-both-webgl-and-webgpu-in-babylon-js-8379272a4306#:~:text=Transparently%20supporting%20both%20WebGL%20and,GLSL%20for%20WebGPU%27s%20shader%20language)) ([Transparently supporting both WebGL and WebGPU in Babylon.js](https://babylonjs.medium.com/transparently-supporting-both-webgl-and-webgpu-in-babylon-js-8379272a4306#:~:text=Babylon,GLSL%20for%20WebGPU%27s%20shader%20language)).
- You can write a fullscreen quad shader in WebGPU (WGSL) directly, but you’d be doing low-level work. No high-level CRT library exists yet for WebGPU specifically.
- WebGPU might give better performance on high-res displays or allow more advanced effects (like compute shaders for more accurate phosphor glow or beam dynamics), but until Safari and all major browsers fully enable it, stick to a WebGL implementation with optional WebGPU path later. In summary, design your shader effect in GLSL now; it should be portable to WGSL in the future with minor changes.

## Including the Cursor in the Effect

Including the mouse cursor in the CRT shader effect is tricky because the browser’s native cursor is rendered *outside* the page’s DOM (by the OS). Even if you apply a CSS filter or a WebGL canvas overlay, the default `cursor: url(...)` image won’t be affected – it’s not part of the page bitmap. **Solution:** hide the native cursor and draw your own cursor element that can be captured by the effect:
- Since you already have a custom PNG, you can set `cursor: none` on the body (to hide OS cursor) and use a fixed-position `<img>` or a small canvas that follows the mouse coordinates. Update its position on `mousemove` (this is usually seamless at 60fps).
- Make sure this custom cursor element is included in whatever you’re feeding into the shader. For example, if using React-VFX or Curtains on a container that now contains the cursor `<img>`, it will be part of the WebGL texture and thus distorted/blurred like everything else.
- If using a pure WebGL approach (Three.js or glfx), you can optionally draw the cursor onto the source texture. For instance, if you have an offscreen canvas of the UI, also draw the cursor PNG at the current mouse position onto that canvas each frame before applying the CRT shader.

This approach is confirmed by others: a Stack Overflow discussion on filtering a custom cursor concluded that you must “implement your own cursor” (use an HTML element) to apply effects, since you can’t directly filter the OS cursor ([javascript - Backdrop-filter on a custom cursor? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58211017/backdrop-filter-on-a-custom-cursor#:~:text=)). The downside is slightly more work (and ensure your custom cursor element doesn’t interfere with pointer events; you might give it `pointer-events: none` so clicks pass through).

**Performance considerations for custom cursor:** Updating an HTML element’s position each frame is generally cheap, but if you’re doing an expensive capture of the whole screen, you might consider not redrawing the whole effect on *every* mouse move (unless needed). If your WebGL effect is running continuously (animating scanline flicker, etc.), then it’s already refreshing, so adding the cursor is fine. Just be mindful that on Safari, hardware-accelerated CSS and WebGL can be impacted by frequent layout changes – but an absolutely positioned element moving shouldn’t trigger reflows, so it’s okay.

## Performance Tips and Safari Optimization

- **GPU Load:** Full-screen post-processing can be heavy. Test on devices (especially if you need to support Safari on iPhones/iPads, which have weaker GPUs than desktops). You may need to reduce effect quality on mobile (e.g. skip heavy blur or lower resolution). Safari on iOS has known WebGL performance limits – e.g., it might have stricter texture size limits and was historically slower ([Why is WebGL so slow in Safari for iOS? - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Safari/comments/16uiqtt/why_is_webgl_so_slow_in_safari_for_ios/#:~:text=I%27ve%20been%20developing%20WebGL%20games,this%20webgpu%20demo%20in)). Keep your shaders optimized (avoid heavy loops, sample textures minimally).
- **Combine Effects:** Where possible, use a single shader to do multiple effects in one pass. For example, a single fragment shader could take an input texture and apply barrel distortion, a color fringe, and a scanline darkening all at once. This avoids multiple render passes and texture swaps.
- **Use Separable Blur:** If you need a strong blur (phosphor glow), do it in two passes (horizontal then vertical) or use a built-in bloom which does this. This is much faster than a large 2D convolution in one pass.
- **Limit Frame Rate if Needed:** If your app is mostly static, you don’t need to run the effect at 60fps. You could re-run the post-process only on interactions or on a timer. For instance, the CRT effect might update at 30fps which might be sufficient and less battery-draining.
- **Safari WebGL Quirks:** Safari 15+ supports WebGL2 but it may default to WebGL1 or have some features flagged. If you use WebGL2 contexts (for float textures or multiple render targets in advanced shaders), test in Safari – you might need to enable the “GPU Process: Canvas” flag or fall back to WebGL1 contexts for compatibility. Libraries like Three.js handle this internally, but if you write raw WebGL, be defensive (check for extension support).
- **Memory:** A full-page render target at 1080p or higher will use memory on the GPU. Ensure you properly size and reuse framebuffers. On Safari/iOS, using too large textures can fail; using power-of-two texture sizes might improve compatibility.

In summary, **recommended libraries** include **React-VFX/VFX-JS** for an easy React integration, **Curtains.js** for direct DOM-to-WebGL mapping, or a custom **Three.js + postprocessing** setup for maximum control. Each can produce the CRT effects (warp, blur, scanlines, chromatic aberration, glow) with the right shader or combination of passes. For instance, using Three.js one could mimic the *cool-retro-hyper* preset which already demonstrates all those effects ([cool-retro-hyper - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cool-retro-hyper#:~:text=coolRetroHyper%3A%20,2)) ([cool-retro-hyper - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cool-retro-hyper#:~:text=pixelization%3A%20false%2C%20rgbSplit%3A%200,08)). Always test on Safari during development – ensure it runs smoothly there, as Safari’s performance can differ from Chrome’s. With a GPU-based solution, you’ll get the authentic CRT feel across the entire app, cursor included, with acceptable performance if tuned well.
